* What is this?
In this repository I have all my code that
- Does not deserve a separate repository
- Only some experiments with new libs or programming languages

If a codebase exceeds the limit of usability I separate it to its own repository

* Projects
** Basic backtester
This is the code in the ~basic_backtester~ subdirectory
