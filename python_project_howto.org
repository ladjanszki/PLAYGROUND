* Intro
During the last years I did not have as much time developing code. So as I getting back to track again I decided to have a doc about best practices.

* Tools
** For version control use GitHub
** As IDE use Emacs
** Develop in a virtualenv
** Test the dependencies in Docker
* Development
** Naming a Python project
** Repo structure
*** One file project
First start small. 
- Have just on source file
- one tests file
- Have a LICENSE
- requirements.txt
- .gitignore
- README.org
*** Multiple file project
- Put all the code into a Python module.
- Put test fo all the classes and functions into its own tests module
- Have a main file named the same as the module 
  This can be used as a command line starting point for the applications
* Libraries
** Pandas
** Unittests
** Numpy
